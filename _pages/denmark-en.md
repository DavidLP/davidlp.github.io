Europe is beautiful and modern, but the same is not true for its outdated marriage laws which are not geared towards binational couples. Rigid German beaurocracy adds a layer of complication making the entire process an administrative nightmare. Fortunately, there is one country in the EU that defies the [EU regulations](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003R2201&from=en): Denmark. Why get married in Las Vegas, when you can do it in Denmark! 

Therefore, we are happy to welcome you to stage 1 of our multinational wedding celebration: *Bryllup i Danmark*. 

On the 14.08.2021, we will officially tie the knot in Copenhagen. Due to the very short notice, this event could be planned only with a small guest count. We know many of our near and dear ones are unable to grace this occasion with their presence. Since it is important for us to include you in this important event of our lives, we decided to make time and distance obsolete and allow you to watch, participate, and enjoy our wedding as it unfolds via a [live videostream]({% link _pages/live-en.md %}). Dont worry if you cant make the time, videos and photos will be made available [here]({% link _pages/media-en.md %}).

# Schedule 14.08.2021

## 11:30 am: Civil marriage
  ![image-right](/assets/images/Frederiksberg.jpg){: .align-right}
  At the Frederiksberg City Hall, we say ‚yes‘ to our futures together. [Frederiksberg](https://www.frederiksberg.dk/en/english) is a charming small city completely surrounded by the Copenhagen city area. The ceremony itself will be short n‘ sweet, as we always like it (~10 minutes) :wink: Despite Corona, we plan for all our guests to witness this event.

  ![image-right](/assets/images/Church.jpg){: .align-right}
  God blesses our union at the [Saint Peter's Church](https://sanktpetrikirke.dk/), Copenhagen. It is the oldest church in Copenhagen and is the parish church of the German-speaking community in the city. Hence, the blessing will be in English, German, and Danish!

## 7:00 pm: Dinner by the water
  We would be delighted to relax and spend the evening over dinner and drinks with our beloved guests at the [Ravelinen](https://ravelinen.dk/) restaurant on a peninsula. It is probably something between "fine dining" and beer garden.

  The restaurant is about a half hour walk from the hotel where most of us are staying.
